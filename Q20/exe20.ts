// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let languages : string []=['english','urdu','hindi','french','arabic']
console.log('list of Languages:')
for(let lang of languages){
    console.log(lang)
